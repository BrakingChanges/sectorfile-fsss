//  * This page is in development. Come back soon.//

==== Runway Selection ====

  * The preferred landing runway at FSIA is runway 31, winds permitting, as it offers an ILS approach and a quick exit to the apron.
  * The preferred takeoff runway at FSIA is runway 13, winds permitting, as it offers a shorter taxi to the threshold.


==== Runway Change Operations ====
//
  * Runway changes must be coordinate with existing DEL, GND, TWR, DEP and APP controllers.
  * If possible, hold aircraft on stand before a runway change operation.
  * If an aircraft is already taxying on Twy F, offer the pilot the option to use the existing active Rwy or to enter the runway for taxiway direction change.
  * If an aircraft as already passed an approach IAF fix, an APP or TWR controller should advise the pilot of the possibility of a runway change prior to the aircraft being on the final approach segment.//
